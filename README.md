# Demo Homework Repo

This repository is a demo repository that you can use to practice your GitHub and git skills while working
throught he online lessons in the [introduction to earth data science textbook on earthdatascience.org](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/). We will not merge any pull requests here but you can practice opening and closing them here if you want!

It is even more painful to see that the person has not been actively using the account. Like how will you use my trademark for something and make it dormant. I really think of writing to gibhub to claim the username. Maybe??
